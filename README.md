# Multi-Client-Chat-Application
"I developed a multi-client chat application using C++ and Winsock. This project implements both the client and server in a single codebase. It allows multiple users to connect, send messages, and broadcast messages to all connected clients. I used multi-threading to handle concurrent client connections and manage real-time communication."
